<h2>Problem - The Tale of Two Architectural Explosion Chambers<a class="headerlink" href="#problem-the-tale-of-two-architectural-explosion-chambers" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Engineers like to describe their software with pictures.  Often these pictures
look like a bunch of blocks connected by arrows.  The blocks represent the
different system states and the arrows represent the things which cause change.
Pictures drawn like this are called finite state machines (FSMs).</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/simple_fsm.pdf"><img alt="_images/simple_fsm.svg" class="noscale-center" src="_images/simple_fsm.svg" /></a>
<p>Generally speaking if you follow some rules while you draw your picture, that
drawing technique is called a formalism.</p>
<p>The FSM formalism is an architectural time bomb.  The number of blocks and
arrows needed to model a simple system is modest and understandable.  But there
is an exponential relationship between the number of blocks and arrows and the
system’s requirements.  As your requirements increase overtime, your drawing
will quickly become a complex monstrosity.  This effect is so dramatic, it has
been given the name: “state-space-explosion”.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/iterations_fsm.pdf"><img alt="_images/iterations_fsm.svg" class="noscale-center" src="_images/iterations_fsm.svg" /></a>
<p>It follows then, that any useful engineering formalism should compress
complexity within the model, not make your model more complex than the real
system.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.ocregister.com/2008/08/04/officials-explosive-could-have-blasted-4-homes/"><img alt="_images/bomb_disposal.jpg" class="noscale-center" src="_images/bomb_disposal.jpg" /></a>
<p>In 1987 an applied mathematician, David Harel neatly solved “state space
explosions” by inventing some new drawing rules.  He named these drawing rules:
“hierarchical state machines” (HSMs) and “parallel regions”.  A HSM allows for
blocks to be drawn within blocks; an inner block containing all of the behavior
described by an outer block.  A parallel region, is represented as a dashed line
within a state’s block.  Each side of the dashed line defines a region and a
region describes a concurrent operation.  A diagram describing an HSM with or
without parallel regions is called a statechart.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/hsm_and_parallel_regions.pdf"><img alt="_images/hsm_and_parallel_regions.svg" class="noscale-center" src="_images/hsm_and_parallel_regions.svg" /></a>
<p>David Harel’s drawing rules ensnare tremendous amounts of complexity.  An HSM
contains the rules of an FSM within it, so an FSM can be refactored into an HSM
as your design progresses.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="_static/iteration_refactor_fsm_to_hsm.pdf"><img alt="_images/iteration_refactor_fsm_to_hsm.svg" class="noscale-center" src="_images/iteration_refactor_fsm_to_hsm.svg" /></a>
<p>If you model systems using his techniques you will end up with small and
intuitive diagrams which can easily adapt to future requirements.</p>
<p>When state machines are running in parallel regions they are running at the same
time: both regions react to the events which are sent to the statechart.  This
means that your statemachine can have more than one active state.  Such an idea
is easy for a theorist to envision, but it is much harder for the practitioner
to implement.  Regions can exist within regions, and each region represents a
parallel execution of code, with access to common outer memory and a need to
react to events managed by other parts of the program.  It is like applying
topology to your system forks.</p>
<p>In the 1990s a number of firms offered proprietary statechart picture/compiler
programs.  But if you pay for a compiler and the computer language you are using
only works with one vendor’s technology, that vendor has an incentive to keep
their prices low, wait for you to get profitable, then jack their prices and
extract a rent from your firm.  This is called vendor-lock-in.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, Miro Samek liberated statecharts from vendor-lock-in with his
paper titled <a class="reference external" href="https://www.embedded.com/state-oriented-programming/">State-Oriented Programming</a>.  His algorithm
supported the block within block part of the statemachine picture, but it did
not support the dashed line: parallel regions. He went about addressing the
“concurrency problem” in a different way, he invented the <a class="reference external" href="https://aleph2c.github.io/miros/patterns.html#patterns-orthogonal-component">orthogonal
component pattern</a>:
an HSM running within another HSM (HHSM).</p>
<p>Not only did Miro Samek describe how to write a statechart’s event processing
engine, he provided the C and C++ code to do it.  He wrote books to support
these code bases: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CT8QTP4/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i1">Practical Statecharts in C/C++: Quantum Programming for
Embedded Systems</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BFSH86J/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0">Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++: Event-Driven Programming for Embedded
Systems</a>
(one of the best computer books I have ever read).</p>
<p>Since the event processor was written in C/C++ a firm’s statechart designs
became completely free from vendor-lock-in, since compiler’s had already become
open source by that time.  The library itself was written in such a way that you
could draw a picture in Umlet, then translate the drawing into your C/C++ code
without a lot of effort.</p>
<p>Both David Harel and Miro Samek went about containing the architectural “state
space explosion” caused by FSMs.  One method was practical from an
implementation perspective and the other was more pictorially expressive in how
it described concurrency.</p>
<p>At some point an industry standard was established for mapping statechart
pictures into XML: SCXML.  The idea being that you could move your XML between
statechart engines, or send serialized specifications of behavior over the wire.</p>
<p>This project is about having cake and eating it too.  The library this project
is <a class="reference external" href="https://aleph2c.github.io/miros/html/index.html">dependent upon</a> uses Miro
Samek’s algorithm and thereby doesn’t implicitly support parallel regions, but
it does support the orthogonal component pattern.  So I will use the orthogonal
component as a kind of assembly language.  To specify how a statechart should be
drawn, I will implement an XML to statechart parser to do this I will use a subset of
the SCXML standard.</p>
<p>To summarize: this library is about bringing parallel regions to the Miro Samek
algorithm.  The drawing rule to make these HHSMs will just be those described by
David Harel, and yet the code will follow the Miro Samek philosophy of being
comprehensible and accessible.  There will be no picture drawing tool, instead
the library will consume XML, which could easily be written by a picture drawing
tool if someone wanted to write one.</p>
