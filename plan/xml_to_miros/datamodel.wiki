  *What defines Success?:* ([[subgoals.datamodel|subgoals]])
    Understand how to create a datamodel approach that can be used by miros with the
    SCXML standard.  Ideally this data model would support python, but to make
    the SCXML generated by miro to be portable to other platforms, it should
    support datamodels that comply with other platforms.
